## Project Info

Simple implementation of Rock Paper Scissors game from The Odin Project [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/rock-paper-scissors).
This is my first **HTML/CSS/JS** project. **Live version** of the game is [here]().

## Description

To play the game, simply choose rock, paper, or scissors by clicking the corresponding button. The AI opponent will randomly select its move, and the winner of each round will be determined based on the classic rules:

- Rock beats scissors
- Scissors beats paper
- Paper beats rock

The player with the most wins after 5 rounds is declared the overall winner. Enjoy the game and test your luck against the AI!

## Benifits

- Gained experience in **manipulating element styles** using JavaScript (setting attributes, adding/removing classes, modifying inline styles and text).
- Enhanced my **comprehension of JavaScript functions** (organization, scope management, invocation, and decomposition into smaller functions).

### Summary

- The game is **completely playable** within the browser.
- I focused on maintaining **clean and readable code**, with **concise functions** and **clear function names** throughout the code. âœ¨
